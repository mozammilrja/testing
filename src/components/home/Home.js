    <p  className='text-lg px-4 text-[#f1c40f]'>
    The Web3 security revolution, this new paradigm shift in information security is so significant that it deserves newer more advanced methods of security. Traditional website and app bug bounty platforms have been successful in the old-world model but there is a massive difference between the existing bug bounties and the new era of Web 3.0 bugs associated with blockchains and crypto.
      </p>
    <p  className='text-lg px-4 text-[#f1c40f]'>
    In the era of Decentralised Finance, Web 3.0 bug bounties take on the critical nature of being associated with actual monetary value, not just software bugs. With DeFi, billions of dollars in user funds are locked in smart contracts, visible and accessible to all. The stakes are pretty high!
      </p>
    <p  className='text-lg px-4 text-[#f1c40f]'>
    Vulnerabilities in code represent a possibility of a direct loss of users’ money. Bug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to find those vulnerabilities in exchange for a reward. Secure smart contracts, save funds, and get paid doing it!

                  <Accordion.Body>
                  If you’re looking to add a layer of protection to your online assets, bug bounty programs are a great way. It is a crowdsourced penetration testing program that rewards for finding security bugs and ways to exploit them. For cybersecurity professionals, it is a great way to test their skills on a variety of targets and get paid well for the same.

                  <Accordion.Body>
                  Using a bounty program is a cost-effective way to improve cybersecurity as you pay when bugs are submitted and validated. Rather than relying on a single security professional, bug bounty programs attract hackers with diverse backgrounds and varying degrees of experience to improve security. Having access to the global hacker community ensures that all assets in scope are tested thoroughly.

                  <Accordion.Body>
                  It’s generally allowed, but we recommend against it as it reduces confidence in your program in the eyes of the hackers as they might be working on something, only to find out that it was just removed. If you plan to regularly add or remove assets, we would suggest having a grace period where hunters would still get rewarded for the vulnerabilities in those assets.

                  All the ImmuneBytes bug bounty programs use our Vulnerability Severity Classification System. Though we give full liberty to our clients to alter this system, we require that this be clarified before the launch of the bug bounty program so that it’s clear to the bounty hunters.

                  <Accordion.Body>
                  We would recommend against it as having a bug bounty program during an audit with a deadline. You may receive duplicate reports from the bug bounty program and the auditing firm. However, in the case of a live product, it may be a wise decision to have a bug bounty program running.

                  As a security firm, our job is to dissect the code for any bugs and keep hackers at bay. The most effective way to do this is via a Bug Bounty Program. We aim to bring together the projects and also look into things from the hacker's perspective to strengthen your smart contract. Running a bug bounty program is getting ahead of the game by being proactive and predictive. We plan to provide bug bounty hosting, consultation, bug triaging, and program management services to various projects seeking it.
